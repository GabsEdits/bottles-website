It's Release Day again!

This release comes with a bunch of bug fixes, improvements and new translations. 
This is a small update that improves Bottles stability but does not implement 
any new features.

This is the first release that will also arrive on the elementary OS AppCenter 
(in the next few days).

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Improved Download Manager
In previous versions, when a component was downloaded, Bottles did not make 
sure that it was actually downloaded and it (rarely) crashed, as it was unable 
to extract the file, as it was not actually downloaded for some reason (e.g. 
example when it is temporarily not reachable).

Now if the download is not verified, the user will be notified, who can try to 
download it again.

### Wrong component naming
Bottles manages multiple runners, these come from different (verified) sources 
and are compiled into different methods, this causes a different nomenclature 
and structure of the files. To standardize everything, Bottles renames the 
files once downloaded. In the previous version, some runners were not 
recognized due to a bug that did not keep track of the renamed file.

## Async DXVK/VKD3D
Now enabling and disabling of DXVK and VKD3D happens in synchronous mode, so 
the program doesn't get stuck anymore. Once the status of one of the components 
has been switched, the switcher will be disabled until the procedure has been 
completed.

## Run executable with arguments
In the previous version there was a regression in the "run executable with 
custom arguments" functionality. In fact, once the arguments were entered and 
saved, Bottles crashed, making it impossible to use the feature. In this 
version it has been fixed.

## All other changes

other noteworthy ones, for all the others, refer to
