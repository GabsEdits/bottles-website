It’s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release brings many new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Steam Proton Prefixes
After months, support for Steam Proton prefixes is finally available!

This new feature allows you to manage Proton prefixes created by Steam. This 
kind of prefix is not a common Wine prefix, it explicitly requires Proton and 
other arrangements. Once you enable support and restart Bottles, you will notice 
a new section in the bottles list, here all your Steam games running through 
Proton will appear. Clicking on one of these will take you to a limited bottle 
view that allows you to manage some features and settings of the prefix.

<img tooltip="Bottles Steam Proton bottle (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-steam-proton-prefix-dark.png" />

The game linked to the prefix is shown in the program list and instead of 
the play/stop button we are used to, there is a button to start it via Steam.

As mentioned above, this is limited prefix management since some features are 
entirely handled by Proton and/or Steam and altering them can cause irreparable 
problems. For example, it is not possible to change the runner, Bottles 
automatically identifies the version of Proton used by the prefix and every 
operation is performed using that.

The bottle generated by Bottles to handle this kind of prefix are temporary, 
meaning that it is recreated each time it is started. This one unlike the 
other bottles, consists of only the configuration file that is generated by 
parsing the launch options set on Steam. This choice was made to preserve 
consistency between Bottles and Steam, preventing the user from making changes 
that will be lost with the next boot.

Nowadays, it is not possible to apply changes to Steam's launch options 
while it is running, which is why you need to restart Steam to apply them.

If you wish to try this feature and use Bottles' Flatpak, remember to
[give](https://docs.usebottles.com/flatpak/cant-enable-steam-proton-manager) 
Bottles the permissions to reach the Steam installation path and any external 
Steam libraries if configured.

We have many other plans for this feature in the near future e.g. allow 
changing the version of Proton (e.g. GE-Proton).

Although this feature has been tested for a long time, there may be bugs. 
Be sure to report them on our GitHub repository.

### Epic Games Store Integration
With the previous version we began to implement a number of integrations with 
some software installed in the bottle. After Steam we moved on to Epic Games 
Store, once the feature is enabled just reload the programs screen of the bottle 
to list all the games that have been installed through Epic Games Store.

<img tooltip="Bottles Steam Proton bottle" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-egs-integration.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Steam Proton bottle" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-egs-integration-dark.png" />

Unlike the integration with Steam, launching a game does not launch via Epic 
Games Store, as we have not been able to get positive results with the official 
method which, as of today, seems not to work anymore (we have feedback from 
other managers as well), we are working on a solution.

### New Per Program Overrides
We have added new possibilities for overriding bottle settings per program.

These, as the title says, are program-related settings that override those 
set in the bottle, for example we can have DXVK active in the bottle and set 
an override to avoid using it with a program.

The following new overrides can now be set:
- Current Working Directory
- FSR
- PulseAudio Latency
- Virtual Desktop

### EasyAntiCheat and Battleye Support
Our runtime has been updated and now provides the libraries needed to run 
EAC and Battleye, the two popular anticheats. Obviously the game developers 
must have enabled Linux support to run and the runner must support these 
(Caffe 7.10-1 has been updated with the necessary patches).

Although these have been implemented along the lines of the Steam 
implementation, they may not work properly and we ask that you report anomalies 
in our GitHub. It is important to point out that we as Valve itself, are not 
responsible for any bans.

### Repository Update Feedback
Bottles on startup downloads the updated version of its repositories (about 
20kb), which are essential for Bottles to function properly. For transparency 
we decided to include a small note in the loading view.

<img tooltip="Bottles Steam Proton bottle" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-loading-repository.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Steam Proton bottle" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-loading-repository-dark.png" />

These repositories are essential and we are looking for a way to cache that does 
not prevent the user from receiving important updates.
