It’s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it’s time to celebrate another 
release day!

This release brings performance/UI improvements and bug fixes.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Common Names
Wine and all the technologies that revolve around it (such as DXVK, VKD3D, 
LatencyFleX etc ..) have always been full of complex terms and almost 
unattainable by less experienced users, who tend to use them leaving a bit of 
mystery and without wondering what they really are. .

With this update we have changed the internal terminology, aiming to explain 
what these are instead of dropping terms in the UI in the hope that people will 
understand them. The bottle preferences now use more generic and explanatory 
names, so that the user is introduced to a small summary of what that setting 
is going to do when turned on or off.

<div class="grid-pics">
    <img tooltip="Bottles Common Names" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-common-names.png" />
    <img tooltip="Bottles Common Names pt.2" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-common-names-2.png" />
</div>

<div class="grid-pics">
    <img tooltip="Bottles Common Names (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-common-names-dark.png" />
    <img tooltip="Bottles Common Names - pt.2 (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-common-names-2-dark.png" />
</div>

For example DXVK has been renamed to Direct3D 9/10/11 Compatibility, suggesting 
that enabling it will add compatibility to the software that needs this.

### PulseAudio Latency Switcher Deprecation
Latency is a concept found in sound processing that indicates the short period
of delay between when an audio signal enters a system and when it emerges. The 
lower the latency is, the more responsive sounds appear.

We used to provide an option to reduce latency through PulseAudio, improving
the sound quality. This option is now activated by default and the switcher
removed from the user interface, suggesting to the user that it is a new
default optimization. The option can still be tweaked by the user setting the
`PULSEAUDIO_LATENCY_MSEC` environment variable to a different value (`60` by
default) in the Bottle preferences.
