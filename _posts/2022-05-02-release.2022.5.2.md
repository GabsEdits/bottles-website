Yep, sounds strange but: it's release day!

Following our intervention at the [Linux App Summit 2022](https://conf.linuxappsummit.org/event/4/timetable/#all), 
we tried to get things moving in the GNOME Circle and we received a lot of great feedbacks on our [application issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Circle/-/issues/61) 
we wanted to focus immediately on fixing what needed to be fixed and update our UI to be respectful of the Circle requirements.

This update improves first user's experience adding guidance to the main steps of Bottles' usage and removes "noise" that could 
cause distraction and confusion on the tasks.

Of course we didn't forget some "not related" bugfix!

## News
We changed... a lot. It's screenshot time!

### UI improvements
The user interface received, again, a complete review.

The text input for a new bottle is now more accessible:

![New bottle name](/uploads/bottles-new-bottle-2022.5.2.png)

It's now clear what you should do the first time you create a bottle:

<div class="grid-pics">
    <img src="/uploads/bottles-details-no-programs-2022.5.2.png" title="No programs in details" />
    <img src="/uploads/bottles-no-programs-2022.5.2.png" title="No programs" />
</div>

The bottle control buttons have been cleared once again:
![Bottle controls](/uploads/bottles-ui-buttons-2022.5.2.png)

New tips have been added to Dependencies and Installers view:

<div class="grid-pics">
    <img src="/uploads/bottles-dependencies-title-2022.5.2.png" title="Dependencies" />
    <img src="/uploads/bottles-installers-title-2022.5.2.png" title="Installers" />
</div>

The importer has been completely redesigned and is now self explanatory:
