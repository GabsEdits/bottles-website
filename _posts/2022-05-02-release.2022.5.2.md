Yep, sounds strange but: it's release day!

Following our intervention at the [Linux App Summit 2022](https://conf.linuxappsummit.org/event/4/timetable/#all), 
we tried to get things moving in the GNOME Circle and we received a lot of great feedbacks on our [application issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Circle/-/issues/61) 
we wanted to focus immediately on fixing what needed to be fixed and update our UI to be respectful of the Circle requirements.

This update improves first user's experience adding guidance to the main steps of Bottles' usage and removes "noise" that could 
cause distraction and confusion on the tasks.

Of course we didn't forget some "not related" bugfix!

## News
We changed... a lot

### UI improvements
The user interface received, again, a complete review. It's screenshot time:

![UI improvements](/uploads/bottles-ui-2022.4.28.png)

The environment name as well as the architecture and runner are now placed 
under the bottle name. For the architecture we switched to win32 and win64 to 
make it clear that it refers to the prefix. 

The runtime operations menu (shutdown, restart, kill all processes) is now 
clearly more distinctive and accessible. 

All other operations (such as backup and documentation) have been moved to the 
context menu in the headerbar, removing them from the bottle focus being 
non-routine operations.

<div class="grid-pics">
    <img src="/uploads/bottles-deps-2022.4.28.png" title="Dependencies" />
    <img src="/uploads/bottles-installers-2022.4.28.png" title="Installers" />
</div>

The search in the dependencies and installers views is now togglable from the 
dedicated button in the headerbar, saving space when this is not needed.

These also received a contextual menu always in the headerbar, this collects 
on-routine operations, such as access to documentation and reports.

![Paths picker feedback](/uploads/bottles-cwd-path.png)

There are many other cosmetic improvements, for example now feedback is shown 
when selecting a path (for example the current working directory or the 
position of the bottle).

### Improved programs list
The list of programs is the core of our bottle, from there we launch all our 
software and video games. This update fixes a very annoying bug that resulted 
in the play button quickly switching from stop to play in the first 2 seconds 
after opening the bottle, forcing the user to wait before launching a program.
