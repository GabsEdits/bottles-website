It’s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release brings two major additions, some performance improvements and bug fixes.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### vmtouch Support
Bottles introduces vmtouch support, also known as Virtual Memory Toucher.
[vmtouch](https://github.com/hoytech/vmtouch) is a caching utility that lends
us resources to diagnose and control cache. With that in mind, you can manually
enable vmtouch to improve performance!

### New vkBasalt Dialog
Bottles introduces a new dialog to configure vkBasalt! vkBasalt is a
post-processing layer that lets us add multiple effects and layers to modify how
games are rendered on Vulkan. However, many of its features were inaccessible,
and are quite difficult to understand. We put a lot of time to explain these
features are.

#### Per-bottle vkBasalt Configurations
Not only that, we also improved vkBasalt integration by letting users modify
vkBasalt configurations per-bottle. This means that each bottle can now have
a separate vkBasalt configuration!

If you are using a customized vkBasalt configuration, you can migrate by moving
`~/.var/app/com.usebottles.bottles/config/vkBasalt/vkBasalt.conf` to
`~/.var/app/com.usebottles.bottles/data/bottles/bottles/$BOTTLE_NAME/vkBasalt.conf`.
If you are using a custom bottle path, then it should be in
`$PATH_OF_THE_BOTTLE/vkBasalt.conf`.
