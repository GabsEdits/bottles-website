Itâ€™s Release Day again!

Another two weeks of work has been done and it's time to celebrate another
release day!

This release came with a lot of new features and improvements and focus
on compatibility and stability.

## Welcome in Trento
Today, we want to introduce **Bottles Trento**, an important milestone
for the project.

`[put here some confetti cannons]`

Ok jokes aside, this is a major update. In the past we announced the Trento 
project as a total refactoring, only to realize that it was not the best 
decision, as it really required too much effort (special thanks to sonnyp for 
letting us reconsider the idea). We have opted to rewrite the backend one 
update at a time, with a view to future expansion. Today we finished the 
biggest part of the rewrite and the merits were felt immediately. Bottles is 
much more responsive, operations are carried out quickly and many bugs have 
been fixed.

### Why Trento?
This is the second codename since Bottles v3 exists (we no longer use this 
versioning, we switched to the CalVer model).

Trento is a beautiful and fascinating Italian city in Trentino-Alto Adige. 
The founders of the project are Italian and we have decided to enhance our 
territory, using the names of our cities as codename (there are no fixed 
intervals, the codename is changed according to the importance of the update 
and normally when an important milestone is reached. like this).

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Improved dependencies manager
We have worked a lot on the dependencies manager in this version, with a focus 
on the speed and reliability of the installations.

Before many dependencies were decompressed to then extract some resources and 
then place them in their respective directories to make the programs detect 
them. This procedure could be cumbersome and dirty Bottles' temp folder. Now 
the manager extracts only the necessary files, leaving the copy intact in temp, 
optimizing and speeding up the whole process.

With the old method we have also noticed an important problem, namely that the 
files that had to be destined for the system32 and syswow64 directories, were 
actually placed in the wrong paths, this is because Windows uses the syswow64 
folder for 32bit resources and the system32 for 64bit resources when you are 
in a 64bit installation. This might sound strange but it was a very old 
Microsoft choice to help developers go from 32bit to 64bit, as they very often 
hard-scripted paths to files instead of using more suitable methods. With this 
update, all resources are placed in the correct path.

Dependency maintainers will no longer have to manually set the destination 
folder but instead use the `win32` and` win64` placeholders, so that Bottles 
can manage the entire process independently based on the architecture of the 
bottle.

The following is an example from the `d3dcompiler43` dependency:

```yaml
..
- action: get_from_cab
  source: d3dcompiler_43_x86/Jun2010_D3DCompiler_43_x86.cab
  file_name: D3DCompiler_43.dll
  dest: win32
  rename: d3dcompiler_43.dll
..
```

All the dependencies manifest files are already updated to use the new 
placeholders.

This update fixes issues with a lot of games and applications that were
not working properly before. If you still have issues, please try in a new
bottle or force re-install the dependencies you are having issues with.

### Stop running programs
The program list is even more useful and allows you to stop a program when it 
is running.

![Stop running programs](/uploads/stop-running-programs.png)

In fact, once the button is pressed to start the program, it becomes the stop 
button. Meanwhile Bottles will listen to the process and when it stops running, 
it will return the button to its initial state, allowing the user to start it 
again.

### Vulkan ICD loader
ICD (Installable Client Driver) are crucial for proper Vulkan support and 
should be properly configured. Bottles now automatically finds them and
load the correct one according to your GPU vendor (taking care of hybrid 
configurations).

So if you are using an AMD GPU, Bottles will load the AMD Vulkan ICD. If you
are using a AMD+Nvidia GPU combo, Bottles will load the AMD Vulkan ICD only
if the Discrete GPU option is disabled.

### Health check
This new feature provide the user with a lot of useful information about the
system and Bottles environment: distro, kernel, GPUs, if the essential tools
are found, if Bottles is running with custom a local repository and more.

You can provide these information with your bug reports (just press the button
in the headerbar to copy them to the clipboard).

### New DXVK,VKD3D,DXVK-Nvapi installers
Previously these components were installed using official scripts from their
respective creators and maintainers of the projects. These, although reliable, 
can in some cases be slow. We then created a manager that takes care of
installing and removing these components from a bottle, obtaining very quick 
results.

### Gamescope
This release has initial support for gamescope, the micro-compositor formerly
known as steamcompmgr. We made some tests and it seems to work fine but doesn't
came with the Flatpak right now. We could do an update in the next few days to 
bring it to the Flatpak, perhaps as an extension since not everyone may need 
this tool.

From the bottle preferences you can access the complete configuration, setting 
the FPS limit, resolution and scaling.
