It’s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release brings many new features, some proton specifications, performance 
improvements and bug fixes.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Steam runtime
Bottles now supports Steam runtimes (Soldier and Scout). The choice is handled by Bottles, if the option is enabled then Soldier will be used for bottles using a Proton runner while Scout for Caffe and all other runners. To activate it you need to expose the Steam installation path if Bottles is installed as Flatpak.
Of course we didn't forget to allow to create Steam shortcuts directly from the program list.

### Support for xdg-open
It is now possible to launch programs using links with Bottles' protocol. For example `bottles:run/BottleName/ProgramName`. This is will allow us to provide a one-click-install option from our webstite. Be ready for an improved experience!

### UI improvements
There is now a division between usual bottles and those coming from Steam

When opening those bottles there is a filtered view for secure handling of settings

Continuing the challenge of having programs icons everywhere: the library is now showing icons!
