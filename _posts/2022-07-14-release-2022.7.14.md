Itâ€™s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release brings many new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Soda - For an Even More Sparkling Experience
With this release we introduce a new default runner, designed to solve 
compatibility issues and decrease the risk of regressions given by Wine's 
fast development.

#### Why?
The decision to create a new runner took a long time and was not easy, the 
first tests began months ago. The main reason that led us to this choice is 
mainly the direction that Bottles is taking and the need to offer a runner 
that is as compatible as possible with the type of software run by our users 
(mostly games) but without penalizing all others.

Caffe (the previous runner) is based on Wine and strictly follows its updates, 
quickly receiving all improvements but also any regressions. Although Caffe 
provides extra patches that fix some of these and improve software 
compatibility, it was not always the best choice and users were forced to 
choose third-party runners that might not be officially supported when used 
in Bottles.

We had to find a compromise, a development branch that would be kept separate 
from Wine but at the same time receive improvements and fixes. We therefore 
chose to base the new runner on Valve's Wine, the base used for Proton. It was 
not very complex since we use TKG for our runner builds and this allows us to 
compile a variant based on this version of Wine as well as allowing us to 
apply a large number of patches and possible custom without too many 
complexities (we will never stop thanking the TKG team for the enormous and 
valuable work they do).

As a result was born Soda, a runner based on Valve's Wine, with patches from 
Proton, TKG and GE. This runner is designed and tested for Bottles and is 
officially supported, giving us the freedom to fix any problems independently.

The versioning of this release will be different from Coffee and Vanilla since 
Valve's Wine is based on Wine 7.0 and follows its own release cycle. Each 
Soda release will be based on the most up-to-date branch and will be marked 
with a number indicating its build (e.g. 7.0-2).

About the name.. well we think it will be a sparkling experience ðŸ‘€.

#### Will Caffe be Deprecated?
No. Like Vaniglia, we will keep Caffe updated with latest Wine updates and
patches.

### Experimental Sandbox per Bottle
We announced the intent to provide a bottle sandbox several months ago, a 
sandbox that would allow the permissions of the environment in which the 
bottle lives to be restricted. With this release this is present as an 
experimental feature (in early development).

<div class="grid-pics">

</div>

    <img tooltip="Bottles Steam Proton bottle (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-sandbox-per-bottle-settings-dark.png" />
</div>

The sandbox uses flatpak-spawn when Bottles is installed as Flatpak and 
bubblewrap for all other formats.

As always, to activate the experiment, you need to access the Bottles 
preferences and activate the dedicated toggle in the Experiments section, then 
restart Bottles.

### New Installers UI
Since the launch of the installers, we have collected all the reports and 
suggestions and redesigned the user experience according to these. We really
like the result and it gives the user a clear view of what is happening and 
the status of the installation.

<img tooltip="Bottles Installers Refresh UI" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-installers-ui-refresh.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Installers Refresh UI (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-installers-ui-refresh-dark.png" />

Once the desired installer is chosen, a dialog is shown asking for confirmation, 
any other settings follow if required, and the installation process is then 
displayed in a minimal, clean interface.

<img tooltip="Bottles Installers Refresh UI - installing" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-installers-ui-refresh-installing.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Installers Refresh UI - installing (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-installers-ui-refresh-installing-dark.png" />

The progress status is no longer silent and now shows what is happening (e.g., 
whether it is installing dependencies, configuring bottle parameters, 
installing components, or something else).

### Ubisoft Connect Integration
Work continues to integrate Bottles with the Windows software it runs. We are
still in the gaming context, and after Steam and Epic, comes support for the
Ubisoft Connect launcher.

<img tooltip="Bottles Ubisoft Connect Integration" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-ubisoft-integration.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Ubisoft Connect Integration (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-ubisoft-integration-dark.png" />

Once the integration is enabled and Ubisoft Connect is installed in the 
bottle, Bottles will be able to detect the games installed through the launcher 
and will list them in the program list. These will be launched through the 
launcher so as to benefit from the cloud and all necessary implementations and 
controls.

### Library Mode Improvements
Work continues on Library Mode, the multi-bottle library for cataloging all 
installed programs.

<img tooltip="Bottles Library Mode Improvements (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-library-mode-refresh-dark.png" />

Now the library can be reached from the dedicated tab directly on the main 
screen of Bottles. We also started the integration with covers, added support 
for Steam, Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Connect integrations, fixed the icons 
and cleaned up the design in general to make it more uniform with the libadwaita
redesign.
