It’s Release Day again!

This release came with a lot of new features and improvements that we hope
you’ll enjoy. The update is focused on performances, compatibility and
introduces some most-requested features.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### New terminal
Normally, when you start the CMD or the winedbg tool, Bottles will
automatically open theses tools in your system terminal or trough the
wineconsole if running under Flatpak. The latter however, should be
say, it's not the best experience at all, so we decided to provide a
brand new terminal to Flatpak users, so they don't have to deal with
wineconsole.

The new terminal is a bit more polished and user-friendly. The first
thing you'll notice is that the terminal change color scheme based
on the tool you're using (cyan for CMD and orange for winedbg).

It's still at the start of its development and we're working on it. We are
working on bookmarks support, to provide a faster way to execute the most
used commands in one click. Keep in touch.

### Files sandboxing
This is an improvement for Flatpak which allows you to sandbox a file before 
running it. This in addition to providing an additional level of security, 
also solves a permissions problem that caused a silent crash in some 
executables, as the runner was unable to access outside the sandbox.

![Files sandboxing](/uploads/file-sandboxing.png)

So when you enable this feature from the executable context menu, Bottles
will copy the file to the bottle internal storage (times vary based on the
file size) and run it from there. This obviously slows down the process as
we need to move the file, so try without before.

### Execute in terminal
Sometimes you need to read the output of an executable to understand what
is going on. Before, you had to open the terminal and run the entire Bottles
program to get the output, or attach the winedbg utility to a running process.

Now you can simply enable the "Launch with terminal" option from the executable
context menu and Bottles will open the terminal and attach the process to it.

### Versioning
This is not actually a new feature, it was already implemented as an
experimental feature, so you should already know about it.

This feature provide an easy way to save and restore a bottle state. 
Previouslly, when you broke a bottle, you had to manually remove the
edits and the changes you made to the bottle but in most cases, it was
not possible. So now when it happens, you can try to restore the bottle
to its previous state.

### Desktop entries
After multiple requests, it is now possible to generate the desktop entry 
for a program directly from Bottles. Just go to the programs list, choose 
the one we are interested in and click on "Add desktop entry" in the 
context menu.

Sorily, this feature is not coming for Flatpak users, due to lack of
permissions. So if you're using Flatpak, please don't worry about this
feature, we still have other plans for you.

### Bottles Runtime
With this version we are testing a new feature that we would like to receive 
a lot of feedback, namely the Bottles runtime.

This is an archive of libraries from Ubuntu 20.04 which are temporarily added 
to the bottle run if the user activates it. This allows to enhance the 
compatibility level of runners, providing them with a set of libraries that 
are often absent in some distributions. At the moment it is only available 
for Flatpak users (for reasons of time but it will arrive on all other 
formats too) and it is deactivated by default, so you can test it simply 
by activating it from the bottle preferences.

### UI improvements
There are also a lot of UI improvements but only one that we really
wanted to mention is the new Power menu, which was re-organized to be less
cluttered and more intuitive.

As you can see, everything concerning the uptime has been moved totally to 
the right and the Reboot and Shutdown items have been enclosed in a submenu, 
this is because they were previously shown with very similar icons and the 
risk of making a mistake and clicking the wrong one was very high. 

Furthermore, the management of the bottle uptime is not really useful, if
not to simulate a system restart or to stop all running processes, for
this reason we have kept the button to stop all processes out of the menu, 
so that it was quick access.
