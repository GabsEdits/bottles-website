It’s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release brings many new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### New Versioning System
The bottle versioning system is one of the unique features of Bottles. We have 
collected a lot of feedback since its introduction and have rewritten the system 
from scratch to improve its performance and eficiency, as well as to allow much 
more flexible control.

The new system is not limited to just the bottle's files but also extends to its 
configuration, which means that restoring a previous state of the bottle will 
also roll back its configuration to that time.

As shown in the video above, by installing a dependency or enabling a component 
(e.g., VKD3D) and restoring a previous state, they will be removed from the 
bottle, removing all traces of it.

<img tooltip="Bottles Versioning Preferences (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-fvs-prefs-dark.png" />

The new system arrives with several options, all configurable from the Bottles 
user interface. Now the versioning system is on by default for all bottles but 
will not act automatically, you will in fact need to enable the option from 
the preferences, from which you can disable it at any time to pause it.

We also implemented a path exclusion system based on user-configurable patterns.

<img tooltip="Bottles Versioning Exclusion Patterns" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-fvs-ignore-patterns.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Versioning Exclusion Patterns (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-fvs-ignore-patterns-dark.png" />

In the example above, we created a new pattern to exclude all files with the 
`.tmp` extension.

The dosdevices path is excluded by default, since this contains only symlinks 
that you may not want to track.

It is important to keep in mind that enabling or disabling compression will 
re-initialize the repository since the two storage types are not compatible 
with each other. This will not delete any files but will prevent it from 
reverting to a state prior to the change.

### Old States?
Although the old versioning system is still available in Bottles, this is 
deprecated and its functionality has been limited to only restoring states 
already created. Opening a bottle will propose migrating to the new system, 
this will not preserve states but will initialize a new repository based on 
the current state, so consider restoring a previous state if necessary before 
proceeding.

#### Technical Stuff (FVS)
We decided to rewrite this system externally to Bottles, so that we could more 
easily update it as well as allow third-party projects to use it for their own 
purposes.

The new versioning system is called [FVS (File Versioning System)](https://github.com/mirkobrombin/FVS) 
and does what the name promises. The system was written with an eye toward 
handling large numbers of files and consuming as little space as possible, 
thanks to deduplication, an organized catalog, hash comparison, and the ability 
to enable compression (which will decrease the space consumed at the cost of 
increased processing time).

With the following images, we can see the basic concept of FVS and how it works.

In the following examples we will investigate only the first file cell, the 
others follow the same concept and should be easy to understand.

![FVS](https://github.com/mirkobrombin/FVS/raw/main/data/cnpt_1.png)

As you can see, the first file was added, removed and re-added but FVS always 
kept only one copy of that file as it was always the same version.

![FVS](https://github.com/mirkobrombin/FVS/raw/main/data/cnpt_2.png)

The example above shows a different timeline. In State #4 a new file has been 
added in the same place as the one in State #1 but since it is a different file, 
FVS is keeping two files in its storage.

Since the second version of the file is used only by State #4, if we were to 
restore one of the previous States, FVS will permanently delete that file as it 
is not necessary for the other States, this is because FVS per concept does not 
allow travel to the future, so all the States after the restored one are deleted.

### Covers in Library Mode
The UI for Library Mode is finally complete as are most of its features.

With this release we have implemented covers, these are taken from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/)
based on the name of the program we are going to add.

<img tooltip="Bottles Library Mode Covers" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-library-mode-covers.png" />
<img tooltip="Bottles Library Mode Covers (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-library-mode-covers-dark.png" />

We have already started work to allow the addition of custom covers and select 
one from those proposed by SteamGridDB in case the one selected by Bottles is 
not to your liking.

This feature is almost ready to usicre from its experimental phase, planned 
for the next release (2022.8.14).

### UI Improvements
Work also continues in improving the user interface of Bottles. In this release 
we have smoothed out some corners but the most noteworthy update is definitely 
the new About dialog, part of libadwaita.

<div class="grid-pics">
    <img tooltip="Bottles libadwaita About dialog" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-libadwaita-about.png" />
    <img tooltip="Bottles libadwaita About dialog - Health Check" class="on-light" src="/uploads/bottles-libadwaita-about-health-check.png" />
</div>

<div class="grid-pics">
    <img tooltip="Bottles libadwaita About dialog (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-libadwaita-about-dark.png" />
    <img tooltip="Bottles libadwaita About dialog - Health Check (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/bottles-libadwaita-about-health-check-dark.png" />
</div>

The Health Check has been moved from the main menu to the Troubleshooting 
section of the About dialog to make it more intuitive to reach and consistent 
with the user experience designed by libadwaita.
