It's Release Day again!

This release is one of the biggest updates ever, it brings with it the 
inevitable bugfixes but also many aesthetic improvements with UX care, new 
juicy implementations and many, very many, performance improvements.

We are always proud to announce updates but we are particularly proud of this 
and I would like to thank all those who have collaborated directly and 
indirectly. Thanks!

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution
One of the main new features of this release is support for FSR, an Open source 
technology by AMD that "uses cutting-edge upscaling technologies to help boost 
your framerates in-game and deliver high-quality, high-resolution 
gaming experiences, without having to upgrade to a new graphics card".

This is a very fascinating technology that promises excellent results even 
on low-level graphics cards. It is currently only supported by some runners, 
mainly Proton (installable from the Bottles 
[preferences](https://docs.usebottles.com/components/runners)).

It support 4 levels of quality and can be easily adjusted to your needs 
trough the bottle preferences.

### DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling)
This is "a cutting-edge AI rendering technology that increases graphics 
performance by using dedicated AI Tensor Core processors on GeForce RTX â„¢ GPUs". 
DLSS harnesses the power of a deep learning neural network to boost frame 
rates and generate beautiful, sharp images in games.

It is provided by DXVK-NVAPI, an alternative NVAPI implementation on top
of DXVK (the Vulkan-based implementation of DirectX). This technology is
only supported by Nvidia RTX GPUs but others can still activate it trough
the bottle preferences to take the advantage of Nvidia's NVAPI implementation.

The DXVK-NVAPI can be keept updated like other components, trough the Bottles
preferences.

### Sand-boxed homedir
Bottles under Flatpak is fully sandboxed, so you can't access your home
or other files outside the sandbox itself. This mean that also your personal
files are not accessible from inside Bottles, except using portals (like in 
native file chooser).

Each bottle as a userdir `C:\users\` that is symlinked to the real 
home `/home/`. Because of the sandbox, programs installed in your bottles, 
cannot have access to your home, this not only means that you can't access 
your personal files, but also that your programs can't store configurations 
and other data and this can compromise their normal behavior.

To fix the problem, Bottles now breaks the symlink and actually creates these
directories in the sandbox, so the runner can have full acess to these files
and your applications can store configurations and data to work properly.

Wait, I know what you're thinking, and yes. This can be a problem for you,
because the sandbox blah blah blah.. the entire process can be reversed
[read here](https://docs.usebottles.com/flatpak/expose-directories/use-system-home).

## UI/UX Improvements
There are many other news under the hood but for those I refer you to the 
changelog at the end of the article. Now we want to talk to you about the big 
news in the graphics part and they are really many and easy to notice.

The thing that immediately catches the eye is certainly the reorganization of 
the headerbar and the screens in the bottle section. Here, in fact, we have 
reorganized to take care of the user experience, trying to simplify it and make 
it even more enjoyable.

In modern GTK applications, users expect to find stocks in this location. 
Even titles such as actions have been moved to the headerbar, making room for 
the actual contents of the screen and avoiding wasting useful space.

![Bottles 2021.10.14](/uploads/creation.png)

The bottle creation dialog has been revisited, removing superfluous and 
repetitive text, improving the overall appearance and introducing a nice 
animation when it comes to revealing the advanced options.

Also the bottle's details view has been improved. Here the most important
thing is the new "FAQ hub", only for Flatpak users. This is a place where
you can find answers to common questions about Bottles under Flatpak.
