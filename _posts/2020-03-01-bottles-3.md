Bottles v3 has been available for a few days in the stable distribution branch.

## News
This update mainly introduces two big news:
- the new beautiful and intuitive [UI](https://usebottles.com/blog/bottles-3-project-refresh/)
- the new component manager
as well as many (really many) bugfixes and translations.

## UI
As for the UI, our graphic designers (Noëlle and Alvar Lagerlöf) have done an immense job
of study and design, placing each element in its place and creating a complete user experience.

This is not a simple dress, the new interface has led us to modify a lot of code below
the hood, some sections have been completely rewritten, others have undergone drastic changes. All
with the sole purpose of providing the best possible user experience.

More info about the next [UI steps](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/issues/143).

## Chardonnay and other components
A great novelty of this update is certainly the management of the components (wine, proton, dxvk,
dependencies, ..) specifically for the Chardonnay component.

![Chardonnay](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/wine) is our Wine runner. Unlike others, it has it
sole purpose of being a Vanilla build. With the only patches applied:
- [wine-staging](https://github.com/wine-staging/wine-staging)
- josh-flat-theme

The idea is to deliver the latest Wine release as fast as possible. Chardonnay is offers 2
build:
- stable
- unstable (downloadable from Bottles by enabling the RC flag "not recommended, expect bugs")

The download of the components in Bottles v3, takes place through ours
[repository](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/components), here they are cataloged together with the version,
download url and checksum for checking the integrity of files.

Bottles v3 is a giant update and it's hard for us to explain everything that's been done, for
this we invite the most nerdy to browse our repository [GitHub] (https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles)

## What next?
Come già detto, questo è stato un aggiornamento molto importante. To date, Bottles v3 lives with a fairly stable
code, a solid foundation of functionality and a beautiful new UI.

Of course this may be enough but experience teaches me that over time projects evolve and functionalities increase
with needs.
Aware of this, I am sure that we cannot add many other features without weakening the code or having to rewrite
it to a large extent. Therefore We decided to update the v3 only with bugfixes, translations and small improvements
in order to focus all our energies on the next major release: v4.

## What about v4?
With the aim of offering an easily customizable and extendable base, Bottles will be splitted into 4 main components:
- [libwine](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/libwine)
- libbottles
- bottles-gtk (Bottles)
- bottles-cli

**libwine** is a library that acts as an API for Wine, this will include all the methods needed to work with a wineprefix, e.g.:
- replace dll (with automatic backup)
- dll overrides
- add/edit/remove register key
- change Windows version
- uninstall software
- etc

**libbottles** is the library containing the Bottles core, this contains all the methods to manage the bottles, e.g.:
- create bottles
- manage [environments](https://docs.usebottles.com/getting-started/environments)
- manage [dependencies](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/dependencies)
- manage runners/dxvk (in short, the [components](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/components))
- manage installers (i.e. installing programs via our centralized [repository](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/programs))
- backups (import/export)
- versioning
- the download manager
- etc..

it also depends on the previous one, **libwine**.

Bottles (**bottles-gtk**) is the final (Gtk) version of Bottles, with the same
[UI](https://usebottles.com/blog/bottles-3-project-refresh/) already seen in v3. This UI will then use libbottles to 
communicate with our bottles.

It's not hard to imagine what's the purpose of **bottles-cli** at this point.

This will also bring the following advantages:
- a library for wine integration via python (the language for the entire project), this can be exploited by other 
projects which currently lack this functionality
- the ability to create multiple clients for Bottles, possibly one in Qt for better integration with Desktop based 
on this toolkit (for example KDE Plasma)
- a solid foundation, easy to extend without the need to litter the code
- safer future support and ease for third parties to collaborate on the project

So Bottles v3 will be deprecated and not maintained? **NO!**
Bottles v3 remains actively developed, will receive bugfixes, improvements and new translations. It will continue 
to be supported until the release of the first stable of v4 (we have no dates).
