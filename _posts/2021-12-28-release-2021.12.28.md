It’s Release Day again!

Another two weeks of work has been done and it's time to celebrate another
release day!

This release came with a lot of new features and improvements and focus
on compatibility and stability.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### New env vars management
Environment variables are important when working with Bottles, there are 
many cases in which we can use them, for example to pass instructions to 
the DXVK HUD.

So it is essential that these are easily manageable, which was not before 
this update. In fact, before you had to put them all on a single text field, 
boring and difficult when you have a lot of them.

Take a look at how we redesigned it below.

Cute is it?

Now just add the variable name (e.g. DXVK_HUD) and then set its value 
(e.g. devinfo) and that's it. To delete it instead .. guess it.

This means two steps are now required and it may seem more inconvenient, but 
try to imagine it in cases where 3 or more variables are used. Convenient 
isn't it?

### Caffe
Well we drank a lot of coffee in this release, but this section is not 
dedicated to that.

Vaniglia has long been Bottles' default runner. This offers the purest and 
cleanest experience of WINE possible on Bottles. Happy purists aside, many 
of us want maximum compatibility and often download third-party runners to 
achieve this. Well, that's where Caffe comes in.

Caffe is the second official Bottles runner, built on top of wine-tkg-git (a 
huge thank you for their immense work, a really great project), it comes 
with a set of patches that guarantees a high level of compatibility. This 
runner is built on Arch Linux with a very up-to-date set of libraries and 
has been tested on the latest versions of Ubuntu, Fedora and of course 
Arch Linux. In some older distributions it could cause problems and this 
is where we recommend (again) to use Flatpak, where the runtime is up to 
date and offers the necessary libraries and tools to run it at its best.

#### How's different from Vaniglia?
Well mostly it is well built. Vaniglia was compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 using a set 
of scripts (build tools) written by us who downloaded the source, applied two 
essential patches. This however lacked gstreamer and other support essential 
to having a complete experience with WINE.

Caffe has been tested and found to go where Vaniglia could not, we are sure you 
will be happy with it.

PS. Vaniglia will not be deprecated for now.

### Bottles Runtime 2.0
With the previous release we introduced the Bottles Runtime, a set of libraries 
that Bottles injects into the environment to improve runner compatibility.

This feature has been made available to all Flatpak users and will soon be 
available to everyone (unfortunately we didn't make it in time, we plan to 
do it for the next release). The big news here is how this runner was created, 
that is through [runtimezilla](https://github.com/mirkobrombin/runtimezilla), a 
project that allows you to assemble runtime from a given recipe. This tool 
allows you to ensure a correct copy of the libraries, avoiding arranged and 
inconvenient scripts.

In the old runtime some libraries were not loaded correctly and others were 
missing, with this update the problems have been solved and can now be 
defined stable.

### Stability improvements
This is a stability focused update, we have fixed many bugs and crashes but 
also improved several areas of the code for better stability.

It may be that you have noticed some random crashes, sometimes without a log. 
This was caused by an error in the management of tasks, that is, the operations 
that are performed in async in Bottles. For example, when you install a 
component, this happens in async to avoid freezing the interface. The error 
was in the management of the notifications of operations (the menu you see 
in the headerbar when there are operations in progress), this was updated by 
a second thread but being the widget spawned on the main thread, in the update 
phase they could collide causing precisely a crash.

The new management of the tasks takes place through a queue, all the async 
processes send a request to the manager who creates the task and keeps it 
updated, so when it is necessary to update it, a direct request will not be 
made but will act through the manager who in turn will handle the change 
correctly.

Yes well all technical things that we also struggle to understand :D, let us 
know if it works.

## Coming big changes
A few days ago we [tweeted](https://twitter.com/usebottles/status/1474109827433566212)
about how dependencies will be provided in Bottles in the future.

It is about providing small archives with just the essential files we need. 
Since we first introduced our dependency manager, we have made use of tools 
like cabextract and p7zip to extract files from archives and executables. 
Normally these are large files and therefore take some time to download 
depending on the connection you are using. Unimaginable using a data 
connection. So the perfect solution is to download only the necessary files.

We are working on a platform that automate the process, letting it download 
the large files, extract the dependencies and provide just those in a small
archive (where the license allows it).

The process of adding and maintaining dependencies won't change that much. 
At the moment each dependency is supplied with a [manifest](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/dependencies/blob/main/Essentials/vcredist6.yml)
that lists the steps necessary for Bottles to install it, then a `Build`
section will be added to the manifest, containing all the steps necessary 
for the platform to download and create the archive, a sort of recipe in 
short. See an example [here](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/data/blob/main/concepts/dep_pr_build.yml).
