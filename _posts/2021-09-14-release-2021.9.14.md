It's Release Day again!

In this release we worked on the second part of the Bottles code remake, 
improving performance and fixing a number of bugs, making Bottles even 
more stable.

Under the hood most of the code has been rewritten and / or improved to 
fix a series of anomalous crashes found in previous versions. To the delight 
of developers, this release brings a number of improvements and documentations 
to the code, making it easy to understand.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

While this is a release with updates mostly under the hood, there are some 
easily noticeable new features.

### Replace fonts
The dependency manager now supports the `replace_fonts` action, this can be 
used when installing a dependency, to replace one font with another. 

```yaml
- action: replace_font
  font: Source Han Sans SC
  replace: 
    - Dengxian
    - FangSong
    - KaiTi
    - Microsoft YaHei
    - Microsoft YaHei UI
    - NSimSun
    - SimHei
    - SimKai
    - SimSun
    - SimSun-ExtB
```

It is a replace in the bottle register, making it appear that a font is 
installed, offering one with its name. This can be used to install fonts that 
cannot normally be redistributed or are incompatible for some reason. There is 
already an implementation of this new action in 
[cjkfonts](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/dependencies/blob/main/Fonts/cjkfonts.yml)
which will be published in the next few days (the time for the release to reach 
most users).

## Download manager
The new download manager brings many improvements and bugfixes, as well as a 
new, much more intuitive design. In fact, ours was never just a download 
manager, as it also tracks other operations such as creating a new restore 
point or extracting components.

Progress bars have been removed making room for a spinner that indicates 
operations are in progress. When a download is in progress, it will increase 
its percentage to the right, giving you a clear idea of the download status. 
The icon in the headerbar has also been removed, in its place we have put a 
spinner which clearly indicates that there are operations in progress.

It also fix a series of crashes caused by accessing some components through 
an unsafe thread.

## Splitted dependencies
The dependencies list is getting bigger and bigger, so we have decided to 
organize these in a different way. The installed ones are now places on bottom
of the list, and the available ones on top. So you can see what you have
installed, just scrolling to the bottom.

We also fixed a bug that didn't show the "remove" button in some dependencies, 
even if they have the uninstaller.
