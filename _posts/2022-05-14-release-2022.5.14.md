It’s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release introduces some new and interesting features but also greatly 
performance, responsiveness and usability improvements.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Performance improvements
One of the simplest things to notice in this release is for sure the 
responsiveness of some features, for example DLL components (like DXVK, 
VKD3D, DXVK-Nvapi, LatencyFleX ..) now take a few seconds to install.

Dependencies can now register a large number of registry keys with a single 
call, drastically reducing installation time (refer to the maintainers 
documentation).

Improvements also for bottles-cli which now launches programs much faster, 
avoiding some checks that are normally performed when Bottles is launched and w
hich are not necessary in this context. 

In addition, some features now take advantage of a small cache to avoid 
re-processing large data that should not change.

### Programs improvements
The program menu has been designed removing the noise and making it more 
compact and easy to access, now it is easy to reach the most used features.

We also added a new menu item to permanently remove a program.

Now you can create multiple entries of the same program, thus passing different 
arguments to get different behaviors, eg. launch a game directly using 
Origin.exe or create a variant that launches a script after execution.

To automate things even more, now the program list is updated every time a 
manually launched executable ends, in this way Bottles will immediately show 
the new installed programs.

#### Icons
Bottles is now able to generate desktop entries with the official program icon, 
thanks to [icoextract](https://github.com/jlu5/icoextract), a utility capable 
of extracting the icon from the executable.

If that package is installed, Bottles will generate desktop entries including 
icons, avoiding the tedious standard icon.

### Download progress
We are aware that it is confusing when there is no trace of an operation in 
progress, unfortunately many are not easily notified as they do not have a 
progress or a tracking system. But if there are any reasons for these things, 
**there's no excuse for not showing the progress of a download!**

Well now the progress of the downloads is shown from the operations menu.

For all other operations that have no way of being tracked, we are working on 
it and evaluating several options.

### EasyTerm came to the present
If you have installed Bottles as Flatpak you will certainly know EasyTerm, 
the default terminal used for the Windows CMD, the debugger and other operations.

With this release we have added the ability to copy and paste texts, just like 
adults do!

### Need help?
Bottles is complicated software and it can happen that something goes wrong.
For this reason we have spread some dialogs to notify some problems, eg. 
when a custom path is set for the bottles, if this is deleted Bottles will 
notify that it is no longer able to reach it and that the default path will 
be reset.

### Installers improvements
Installers are Bottles' newest feature and are being improved day by day and 
this release brings a lot of news.

To improve the reliability of the installations, installers can now declare a
checks that must be performed before finishing the installation and then add the 
program to the list. These are currently checks if there are files, so as to 
ensure that the installation has taken place, in the future it may be possible 
to search for keys in the registry for even more reliable results.

We have also added the ability to monitor processes before continuing with the 
installation, this solves the problems caused by those installers that spawn 
multiple processes that Bottles loses control of, thinking they can proceed with 
the next installation steps and potentially causing breakage.

There are also a bunch of bug fixes

### More Windows path conversions
With recent releases we have initiated a migration process from Unix-paths to 
Windows-paths for all paths managed internally by Bottles. This may appear as 
just a detail but it marks an important change for the project that brings 
greater consistency, fewer conversions on the fly in case an instrument requires 
it, less space escapes and other characters in the path, greater compatibility 
with Windows software and instrumentation, for example with the system registry 
where it was necessary to include the path to a file or read the contents of 
an .lnk file or generate new ones. 

This will also allow us a much cleaner communication with WineBridge (our 
communication bridge between Bottles and Wine), in short, there are many 
positive aspects of this migration and will be noticed more and more in the 
immediate future.
