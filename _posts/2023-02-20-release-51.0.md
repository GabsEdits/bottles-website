We love release days over here, and this one is not the exception! We have some pretty exciting new stuff, and we continue our polishing that we promised to do last month.

Let's dive right into it!

# "New Bottle" interface
We've changed this dialog, as it was not really clear which environment was selected. Now, we use radio buttons, and it's prettier than ever!

# Quality of Life changes
## New library icon
We've changed the library icon, to really show books, and not simply a "heart" icon. We could have thought of this earlier, but at least now it's done :)

## New toast when launching things with "Run Executable"
Yes, we could also have thought about it earlier, but better late than never, right?

## Runners list order
When runners are printed in the console for example, they will always have a stable and nice order, with Soda, Caffe, Vaniglia, and others. Nice touch!

## Bottle naming
Bottles can now be named without any character restrictions! You can now name a bottle "Assassin's Creed", "Sid Meierâ€™s Civilization", or "Paw Patrol: On A Roll". Which ever game you like.

# Bug fixes
As always with every release of Bottles, a *ton* of bugs have been squashed! Here they are:
- Adding shortcut to Steam now properly works again (after hotfix 51.3)
- Importing full backups should also be fixed!
- A lot of various issues with the library have been fixed, like empty covers, crashes, and it's better than ever!
- Various bugs regarding text encoding, in games and in Bottles
- Bottles list will now be correctly updated after deleting a bottle

There is always more stuff, and you can see the full release notes [here](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/releases/tag/51.0)!
