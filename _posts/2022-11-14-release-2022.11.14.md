It’s Release Day again!

A lot of work has been done this time around and it’s time to celebrate another release day!

This release comes with a redesign of the details and settings page. Also the programs page has been removed.

## News
Ok now let’s get to the point. What’s new in this version?

### Change of the release schedule
We are changing our release schedule from bi-weekly to monthly. We will release each update on the 14th of each month. We used to devote all our time to Bottles, but recently we have started to develop our own projects, like [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org/), [Crystal Linux](https://getcryst.al/site), [Atoms](https://github.com/AtomsDevs/Atoms), [Upscaler](https://gitlab.com/TheEvilSkeleton/Upscaler) and others. In the meantime, we also contributed to other free and open source projects.

Even with the schedule changes, we will continue to develop Bottles, fix bugs and much more. At the same time, we will have more time to polish between updates, as we did especially with this update.

### Brand new details view
The details view has been completely redesigned to make Bottles more mobile friendly. The sidebar has been removed and the pages have been moved into the details view itself.

The option to run an executable is now a nice visible pill to bring it into the focus and launch options are now neatly placed in their own popover next to it. There is a new bottom bar below the programs list to add/install new programs.

    <img tooltip="Details View (dark)" class="on-dark" src="/uploads/details-view-launchopts-dark.png" />
</div>

### Redesigned settings
Settings page has also received an overhaul, similar settings have been rearranged into groups making it easier to navigate through them.

### QoL Changes
A lot of quality of life (QoL) improvements have been made to Bottles to improve usability. "states" have been renamed to "snapshots", rephased dialogs that tell user to wait, renamed "Documentation" to "Help", added mnemonics, and a lot more. Changes to Bottles to comply with GNOME's design guidelines.

Refer to [#2228](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/pull/2228) for full details.

### Removal of color lookup table
We decided to remove the color lookup table feature from the vkBasalt dialog. We realized that supporting color lookup tables is a really complicated task, and it's a topic we know very little about. We aren't sure if it's working correctly or not. We rather remove this feature than provide a potential broken feature. We apologize for users who have been using this feature, but if you understand how vkBasalt's color lookup table works, please don't hesitate to contact us!

### Components installation queue
The component manager now uses a queue for installations, this means that by requiring the installation of multiple components, they will be queued and installed in sequence rather than simultaneously. This choice was made to prevent a large use of resources between the connection and the CPU (for the decompression of the archives).

### PulseAudio latency disabled by default
Following the previous release where the PulseAudio latency option has been deprecated leaving the user the ability to enable it via environment variables, this update disables the default setting so that it is no longer enabled by default for bottles of type Gaming and Software. It will be up to the user to enable it from the environment variables section if necessary.
