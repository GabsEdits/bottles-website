It’s Release Day again!

A lot of work has been done this time around and it’s time to celebrate another release day!

This release comes with a redesign of the details and settings page. Also the programs page has been removed.

## News
Ok now let’s get to the point. What’s new in this version?

### Brand new details view
The details view has been completely redesigned to make Bottles more mobile friendly. The sidebar has been removed and the pages have been moved into the details view itself.

The option to run an executable is now a nice visible pill to bring it into the focus and launch options are now neatly placed in their own popover next to it. There is a new bottom bar below the programs list to add/install new programs.

### Redesigned settings
Settings page has also recieved an overhaul, similar settings have been rearranged into groups making it easier to navigate through them.
