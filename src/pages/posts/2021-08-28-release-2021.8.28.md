It's Release Day again!

Over the past few weeks weâ€™ve been working on a number of bugfixes and 
improvements as well as new features. This is an update that sees a large 
part of the Bottles code rewritten and prepares the basis for Bottles 
Trento (v4).

## Trento?
The original idea for Trento, was to rewrite the project from scratch, using 
the [libwine](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/libwine) library, part of the 
Bottles project. 

Fortunately we managed to avoid this rewrite and started a series of rewrites 
of the Bottles backend, starting with this update. When the codebase is 
compatible, we will begin integrating libwine, aligning with the 
original project.

There will then be other updates that will focus on this source code update.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Prefixes and Suffixes

The most important feature of this update is in the Launch Options of the 
executable. It is now possible to define prefixes and suffixes in the launch 
options of an executable, using the `%command%` placeholder.

![Launch Options with %command% placeholder](/uploads/launch-options-command-placeholder.png)

So everything that is defined before the `%command%` placeholder will be
used as prefixes and after as suffixes, like how it works in Steam.

### New bottle on launch
You may have happened to launch an executable in Bottles directly from your 
File manager and realize that it is not possible to create a bottle where to 
start the executable immediately.

Well now it is possible! Simply choose a Windows executable (.exe/.msi/.bat) 
from your File manager and launch it with Bottles. Then create a new bottle 
and when it's ready, it will launch the executable. Easy?

Obviously it is possible to achieve the same goal using the CLI:

```bash
bottles -e /path/to/file.exe
```

### Better dependencies management
Thanks to the new backend structure, we have also improved the dependency 
manager. This in fact supports new installation methods and can now **extract 
single files** from Windows Cabinet without saturating the Bottles' temp path.

```yaml
- action: download_archive
  file_name: msxml6-KB973686-enu-amd64.exe
  url: https://.../msxml6-KB973686-enu-amd64.exe
  file_checksum: 13a292beb9ebe46ac97b8a4352fe2cd5
  
- action: get_from_cab
  source: msxml6-KB973686-enu-amd64.exe
  file_name: msxml6.msi
  
- action: get_from_cab
  source: msxml6.msi
  file_name: msxml6.dll.86F857F6_A743_463D_B2FE_98CB5F727E09
  dest: drive_c/windows/system32/
  rename: msxml6.dll
```

In the above example, we use the new `download_archive` method to download
the cabinet and `get_from_cab` to extract the `msxml6.msi` file from it. Then
we use it again to extract the `msxml6.dll` and copy it to the destination.
[Full example](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/dependencies/blob/main/Essentials/msxml6_testing.yml)

Also, the cab extraction is now quiet, it will only show essential logs.

This will take some time for all repository dependencies to adopt the new 
system, in fact the old one will remain active as a fallback.

### Crash Report
Now the new Crash Report dialog, show a notice to the user saying that there
is already similar report for that crash (if any).

![Crash Report Notice](/uploads/crash-report-notice.png)

So the user should read and accept the notice to be able to send the report.

Also, in the report the `homedir` is replaced with `/home/USER` to standardize
the reports.

## Bugfixes
There are **a lot of bugfixes** in this release. Let's see the most important 
ones.

We fixed a bug in **Wayland** support via XWayland. A configuration error 
prevented the runner from starting executables under XWayland when the 
`DISPLAY` env var was not set to `0`.

The **custom launchers** added to the program list used an incorrect working 
directory and this sometimes prevented them from starting.

## All other changes
There are a lot of other changes and improvements in this release. Below are 
other noteworthy ones, for all the others, refer to 
the [GiHub organization](https://github.com/bottlesdevs).

* The dependencies/components/installers has now they own managers, indipendent from the main one
* The dependencies manager can now extract single files from Windows Cabinet files
* The user homedir is now removed from the reports
* The lutris-lol runner is now hidden when Bottles is running under flatpak, as it is not compatible with it
* The Windows Cabinet extraction is now quiet and only show relavant logs
* The download status icon in the preferencies dialog, is now on the right of the percentage, so it will be no more moved by the percentage
* Fixed a bug in name resolution that could cause Bottles to crash if it cannot reach a resource
* Prevent Bottles from running executables when the runner is not available
* Environment names are now translated again
