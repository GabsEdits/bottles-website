Itâ€™s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release brings two major additions, some performance improvements and bug fixes.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Library Mode
We often like to experiment with new features; these are usually immediately 
accessible in the experiments section of Bottles, so that users can test them 
and provide us with feedback, so that we can improve and complete them.

This time it is the turn of Library Mode, which becomes an official Bottles 
feature with this release. Before we get into the specifics, we would like to 
thank all the users who have contributed feedback, ideas, and advice!

Library Mode is a new way to access the programs installed in your Bottles. 
Bottles is a wineprefix manager and as such our approach does not start from 
the program but from the wineprefix (bottle); this means that you have to open 
the bottle to access the programs installed inside it, and if we have multiple 
bottles it might be cumbersome. So we integrated a library, a space where you 
can add any program from any bottle, so that you can access all your programs 
from one screen.

At first your library will appear empty, just open a bottle and choose the 
program you want, then from the context menu press "Add to My Library" to add it.

Each added program appears as a card with a cover, the context menu (top left), 
the program icon (bottom right), while below we have the name of the program, 
the bottle, and the button to launch or stop it.

Covers are automatically identified and downloaded from SteamGridDB. We are 
still working on the ability to add covers manually.

To remove a program from your library, you simply go to its context menu (top 
left of the cover) and choose "Remove from Library," this does not remove the 
program from the bottle but only from the library.

### Missing Runner
It may happen that a bottle is altered from the outside or is imported into a 
new Bottles installation without all the necessary components being present.

Now, opening a bottle that requires a runner that is not installed will display 
a dialog warning of this problem, inviting the user to install it or choose 
another one from preferences.

### Legacy Tools - Reorganization
The Legacy Tools section has been re-organized with more specific and intuitive 
names, eliminating the noise that more advanced users (who this section is 
aimed at) might have encountered.

### Runners Updates
The Soda runner has been updated to latest Valve commit.
The Caffe and Vaniglia runners has been updated to Wine 7.15.
