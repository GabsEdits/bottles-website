It's Release Day again! Over the past few weeks we've been working hard on bug 
fixes, improvements, and new features.

This is a substantial update that aims to improve stability and performance in 
Bottles, as well as extend its support with new dependencies, runners and 
features. But let's get into the details.

## News
The most noticable news you can see, is in the **bottle creation view**. We 
have removed the colors from Environments, since they can be understood as 
more or less important and therefore confusing to the user.

### 32-bit bottles
We have also added support for 32-bit bottles. This means that you can now 
create 32-bit Windows prefixes. To do this, you need to select 32-bit in the 
architecture dropdown. Currently it is only supported by the Custom environment.

Be sure to use 32-bit prefixes only if strictly necessary. Most Windows 
software and games run on 64-bit prefixes.

This feature is currently not supported with the Snap package.

### Working directory
Now you can set the working directory for your bottle. This is especially 
useful when you want to run programs in your bottles, pointing to a different 
directory. 

If not set, Bottles will use the directory of the bottle as the working
directory. Also, if a program failes to start, Bottles will try to run it using
its path as the working directory. This can help if the program does not find
its files or some dlls.

### Similar issues
Now, when the Crash Report appears, it will show you similar reports before
permiting to send a new one to us.

### Clone bottles
We added a new feature that allows you to clone your bottles. This is useful
when you want to create with the same preferences, dependencies and software 
of another one.

This can also be used to create bottles templates. So you can create a new
bottle and tweak it to your needs. Then you can create a new bottle based on
this template, just by clicking on the "Clone" button in the bottle details.

### Wayland support
We have added support for Wayland through XWayland. This means that you can now 
start Bottles in Wayland, while applications run by runners, will use XWayland.

Currently, this is not supported by the AppImage, we are working on this.

### Less permissions = more safety
We have reduced the amount of permissions required to run Bottles through the
flatpak package. You can still run an executable from any directory, because
Bottles is using portals for the FileChooser.

Programs launched by the runner, may still require more permissions. You can
expose some directories to Bottles, so that programs can access them. Read more
about this in the [documentation](https://docs.usebottles.com/flatpak/expose-directories).
