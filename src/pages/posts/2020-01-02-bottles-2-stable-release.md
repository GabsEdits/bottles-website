**Bottles** is a project born in 2017 as a personal need and experiment. I 
needed to manage multiple Wine prefixes quickly and easily. At the time there were already many Wine prefix managers out in the wild, but I wasn't comfortable with any of them.

In 2017, I was using **elementaryOS** as my main distribution, and with the 
arrival of **AppCenter** I wanted to publish an application on the new store. For this reason, I decided to create Bottles, my first `Python + GTK + Granite` application to be published in the elementaryOS's AppCenter. A lot of work has been done since then, with other people that decided to join the project: they started to collaborate to improve Bottles, making it a mature and feature-rich program.

From version 0.8 to version 2.0.9.1, Bottles' code has been rewritten from scratch. In the image above you can see the evolution.

## Features

Bottles 2.0.9.1 has a lot of features. Let's see below the main ones, shall we?

- Create bottles (Wine prefixes) based on pre-configured environments, to 
  achieve greater software compatibility
- Create your own custom environment to experiment and test software
- Run Windows executables in your bottles from the context menu of 
  your File manager
- Bottles remembers the arguments you use to run a program
- Custom runners (Wine and Proton) and on-the-fly switch between versions
- Integrated support for DXVK
- DLL overrides without using winecfg
- Bottle tweaking with support to: esync, fsync, cache, ACO shaders compiler, 
  offload, etc.
- Bottles will check the integrity of the bottles and repair them if they're broken
- Winetricks has been replaced by our integrated dependency manager based on a community-driven repository
- Bottles will find the programs you install in the bottle and will propose them 
  to you on the Programs page
