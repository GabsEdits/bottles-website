It’s Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release brings interesting new features and many bugfixes that improve Bottles 
stability and performance, some problems reported on Steam Deck have also been fixed.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Steam proton prefixes
With this release we are introducing a new feature (currently experimental), 
which allows you to manage the Steam proton prefixes directly from Bottles.

Unlike regular bottles created with WINE or Proton in Bottles, Steam prefixes 
use slightly different rules and are tied to the runner they are created with.

Once the new experimental feature is enabled, you need to restart Bottles or 
press the `CTRL+R` combination to force the refresh. Bottles will automatically 
detect new prefixes and create a bottle configuration for each one. 

Bottles reads the Steam configurations to detect the Proton runner used for 
its creation and uses this for all operations; it is therefore not possible to 
change the runner type and version, because this can cause problems and break 
the prefixes.

As mentioned, this is an experimental feature and we therefore suggest you 
to be very careful when using it. In the stable release it will be possible 
to launch the game linked to the prefix via Steam, as well as other programs 
(e.g. modders). Some features doesn't work right now, but will be on the next
release (e.g. mangohud, gamemode, etc.).

### MangoHud support
While it was already possible to leverage MangoHud via Bottles, this was 
integrated directly into the bottle preferences.

Once enabled, just run the game and you will see the MangoHud overlay. Use
the environment variable section to configure the overlay.

> If running Bottles as Flatpak, install `org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.MangoHud`.

### LatencyFlex support
[LatencyFlex](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX) is a vendor 
agnostic latency reduction middleware, alternative to NVIDIA Reflex.

An initial support has recently been integrated into Bottles and can be 
activated from the bottle preferences. To install it you can proceed like all 
the other components (e.g. DXVK, VKD3D, DXVK-Nvapi, etc.), from the Bottles
Preferences.

### New repositories
Bottles uses internal repositories for components, dependencies and installers. 
We were told several times that these were not accessible in some regions and 
we therefore worked to find a remedy.

Thanks to [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), we have a new infrastructure
for hosting our website, forums and repositories.

The process of adding and updating for the maintainers remains the same, it 
will be enough to open a Pull Request in the dedicated repository on GitHub 
and once accepted, this will be reflected in the mirror after a few minutes.

### WineBridge
Bottles aims to manage WINE prefixes in the best possible way, in every aspect 
and at any cost. However, these features are not always easy to integrate and 
are sometimes too cumbersome to be implemented. For this reason [Pietro di Caprio](https://github.com/pietrodicaprio) 
from our team is working on WineBridge, a tool that uses the Windows API to 
clearly offer some information of the Windows sub-system and perform some 
operations in a quick and "native" way.

Although from this release this is a Core component of Bottles, it is currently 
in a testing phase and has been applied to only some areas of Bottles and only 
if this is present. Access the Core section in the Bottles Preferences to
install it.

It is currently implemented as a process manager in the integrated task manager.
