It's Release Day again!

This release comes with a bunch of bug fixes, improvements and new translations. 
This is a small update that improves Bottles stability but does not implement 
any new features.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Improved Download Manager
In previous versions, when a component was downloaded, Bottles did not make 
sure that the component was downloaded and when it tried to extract the
archive, it would fail, resulting in a crash. There was multiple causes that
make this happen, e.g. the resource in temporary inaccessable or the connection
to the server was lost.

Now if the download is not verified, the user will be notified, who can try to 
download it again.

### Wrong component naming
Bottles manages multiple runners, these come from different (verified) 
[sources](https://usebottles.com/database/components/) 
and are compiled in different ways, this causes a different nomenclature 
and structure of the files. To standardize everything, Bottles renames the 
files once downloaded. In the previous version, some runners were not 
recognized due to a bug that did not keep track of the new names.

## Async DXVK/VKD3D
Now enabling and disabling of DXVK and VKD3D happens in synchronous mode, so 
the program doesn't get stuck anymore. Once the status of one of the components 
has been switched, the switcher will be disabled until the procedure has been 
completed.

## Run executable with arguments
In the previous version there was a regression in the "run executable with 
custom arguments" functionality. In fact, once the arguments were entered and 
saved, Bottles crashed, making it impossible to use the feature. In this 
version it has been fixed.

## elementary OS
In this release we worked on porting Bottles to elementary OS. In fact, in the 
next few days, it will be distributed on AppCenter, making it available for 
download.

Few people know that Bottles is an application born for elementary OS in 2017. 

The v1 is 
[already present in the Hera AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.mirkobrombin.bottles/) 
and will be replaced by Treviso (v3). This is an important update (in fact it 
has been rewritten from scratch since v1), nevertheless we want to keep the 
development of both versions active, continuing to provide installation 
packages for the first version of Bottles. We are doing so because they are two 
completely different programs, in fact the first is a small simple tool for 
checking prefixes, while Treviso is a complete manager with unique features 
such as versioning, dependency manager, installers etc .. Also there is an 
emotional value.
