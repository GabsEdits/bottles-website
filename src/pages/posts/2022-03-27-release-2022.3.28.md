It‚Äôs Release Day again!

Two more weeks of work have been done and it's time to celebrate another release day!

This release brings several improvements, work is progressing fast to support 
Steam Proton prefixes and some nice new features!

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Environment recipes
Bottles is a WINE prefix manager based on environments, sets of instructions 
that are interpreted to make a bottle (a la Docker, we can say).

Since v2 we offer 2 pre-configured environments: Gaming and Application. In 
addition to those we have always allowed to create custom bottles that are 
therefore not linked to an environment.

From today it is possible to use your own environments, this means that you 
can reproduce a specific set of instructions at any time and, why not, also 
share it with friends and colleagues.

To use yours, simply select the Custom environment and then choose your recipe.

This way Bottles will follow your instructions.

Recipes are nothing more than YAML files with a well-defined structure, like 
the example below:

```yaml
Runner: wine
Parameters:
    custom_dpi: 120
    discrete_gpu: true
    dxvk: true
    dxvk_hud: false
    dxvk_nvapi: true
    fixme_logs: false
    fsr: true
    fsr_level: 5
    fullscreen_capture: false
    gamemode: false
    gamescope: true
    gamescope_borderless: true
    gamescope_fps: 60
    latencyflex: false
    mangohud: true
    pulseaudio_latency: true
    sync: futex2
    take_focus: false
    use_runtime: true
    virtual_desktop: true
    virtual_desktop_res: 1280x720
    vkd3d: true
Installed_Dependencies:
- d3dx9
- msls31
- arial32
- times32
- d3dcompiler_43
- d3dcompiler_47

```

Beautiful, is not it? Send us feedback, bug hunters!

### Improved Steam Proton support
In the last release we announced experimental support for Steam Proton prefixes. 
While this feature remains under development, there are lots of news about it 
in this release.

In fact, Bottles is now able to read the Launch options of a Steam game 
(installed via Proton) and interpret them in Bottles configurations. So if you
enable MangoHud on Steam, you will see the dedicated toggle switched on.

Of course you can at any time change a setting in Bottles and this will be 
reflected in Steam (be careful because not all settings are available yet, we 
have enabled MangoHud, Gamescope, GameMode, FSR and others). At the moment to 
synchronize settings from one client to another, you need to restart the 
target one, we are working on it.

As you can see in the screenshot above, there is also another big news. In 
fact, Bottles is now able to recognize the game associated with the prefix 
and allows you to start it via Steam. We hope you find it useful.

### Installers improvements
In this release there are several new features also for the installers. There 
are two most important and noteworthy ones.

Now the programs installed through this feature will use a Windows path by 
default instead of unix. This choice was made to maintain as much internal use 
of the paths as possible and ensure a better functioning of WINE.

Installers, who install installers, who install installers, who ... got it?

Now installers can depend on other installers, useful when one program can run 
on its own but others may need it. Maintainers will just need to add the new
`Installers` section to the manifest:

```yaml
...
Installers:
- first_installer
- second_installer
```

and Bottles will automatically install all of them in the correct order.

### New CLI
We finally have a real CLI and it is very powerful!

We have heard your prayers and written a new CLI that covers tons of use cases, 
let's see some of them.

#### How to launch it
The CLI has now a dedicated command: `bottles-cli`. If you have installed
Bottles as a Flatpak, you can launch it by simply typing:

```bash
flatpak run --command="bottles-cli" com.usebottles.bottles --help
```

other packages can reach it at usual way:

```bash
bottles-cli --help
```

And the following is its help page:

```bash
usage: bottles-cli [-h] [-v] [-j]
                   {info,list,programs,tools,reg,edit,new,run} ...

Bottles is a tool to manage your bottles

positional arguments:
  {info,list,programs,tools,reg,edit,new,run}
                        sub-command help
    info                Show information about Bottles
    list                List entities
    programs            List programs
    tools               Launch WINE tools
    reg                 Manage registry
    edit                Edit a bottle configuration
    new                 Create a new bottle
    run                 Run a program

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -j, --json            Outputs in JSON format
```

### List stuff
You can list all your bottles:

```bash
bottles-cli list bottles
> Found 2 bottles:
- Games
- TestLayers
```

as well as components:

```bash
bottles-cli list components -f category:dxvk
> Found 7 dxvk
- dxvk-1.10
- dxvk-1.9.4
- dxvk-1.9.3

```

and programs:

```bash
bottles-cli programs -b Games
> Found 4 programs:
- Battle.net
- Epic Games Store
- Origin
- Ubisoft Connect
```

just typing the right command.

### What about making new bottles?
We have the `new` command for that:

```bash
bottles-cli new --bottle-name Awesome --environment custom --arch win64 --runner Caffe-7.2 --dxvk dxvk-1.10 --vkd3d vkd3d-proton-2.6 --custom-environment /path/to/custom/environment/file.yml
```

### I need to edit a bottle
You can edit a bottle by using the `edit` command:

```bash
bottles-cli edit -b Games --win win7
```

and you can change every parameter of your bottle, even the version of the 
components.

### I am a hacker, I want to launch programs trough CLI üëæ
Wait there is something for you too and you will love it. 
Now you can not only run executables:

```bash
bottles-cli run -b Games -e /path/to/file.exe
```

but also directly a program of your bottle, without having to deal with paths:

```bash
bottles-cli run -b Games -p Battle.net
```

### I'm a developer
Hello! For you today we have the `--json` flag which if set will return any 
output in json format, it should come in handy.

```bash
bottles-cli --json list components -f category:vkd3d
> {"vkd3d": ["vkd3d-proton-2.6", "vkd3d-proton-2.5", "vkd3d-v2.4"]}
```

And many more features are available, refer to the `--help` command to list
all of them.
