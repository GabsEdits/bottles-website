Another great day, when come release day!

In the past few weeks we have worked hard, focusing on three main objectives: 
stability, compatibility and community!

This is one of the most important release of... ok I often say this but I am
always excited for this day üòÖ.

## News
Ok now let's get to the point. What's new in this version?

### Notifications
With this release we have started using an internal notifications system, with 
which we can notify you of updates, tricks and much more! A simple and not at 
all invasive method of staying close to our community which is growing 
more and more and very quickly. Thanks üôè!

![Bottles Notifications](/uploads/notifications.png)

After reading a notification, you can delete it so that it never comes back.

There are multiple notifications types, which are:
- per release (so it will be displayed only to users with the same release)
- scheduled
- on first launch

So after this update, the next time you open the app, you will see a new
notification. Let us know what you think about this feature in our GitHub
repository!

### "Sandbox" for everyone
In the 
[previus version](https://usebottles.com/blog/release-2021.10.14/#sand-boxed-homedir)
we have expanded the sandbox for Flatpak users, also 
bringing the userdir of the prefixes inside the bottle, thus eliminating the 
symlinks to the user's homedir.

Now on request we have also brought this functionality to all other non-Flatpak 
users. Now it is in fact possible to enable the sandbox directly to the 
creation of the bottle (for now only with the Custom environment).

![Bottles Sandbox for everyone](/uploads/sandbox-everyone.png)

To be clear, this isn't a true sandbox. This is not to link the prefix userdir 
to the system user's homedir, so the files will be saved in the prefix itself. 
We currently offer a true sandbox only to Flatpak users and we highly recommend 
everyone to use this format if they want a full-sandbox experience.

### Better performance
We have also improved the general performance of Bottles, rewriting how
components are handled and displayed in the UI. There are also a large number
of bugfixes and improvements on async operations and http requests, these are
now cached on first call, so you don't have to wait for them to be loaded again
next time. We think you will notice these improvements.

### New components and installers
We have also updated our official Vaniglia runner to the `6.20` version, a very
important version that brings many improvements, a special thanks to the Wine 
team for their great work.

There are also new installers for the following
programs:
- GOG Galaxy
- Origin

Installers are still in development, so please be patient and test at your own
risk.

### Installers
Continuing to talk about installers, there is also something new on this front. 
Now it is possible to read the review of an installer directly from Bottles!

![Reviews](/uploads/reviews.png)

Because each of our installers are tested and reviewed by the maintainer 
who has to answer a simple but detailed questionnaire. This is saved as a 
review, so that the user can know for sure what experience they will have 
once they have installed a program with one of our installers.

See [here](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/programs/blob/main/GUIDELINES.md) the
installers guidelines for more information.
