    <p>We have several plans for Bottles' future, many features that take time
      and money to come true.</p>
    <p>Bottles is (today) a project driven by the effort of a single developer and the support of a magnificent community!</p>
    <br />
    <p>- Thanks from the Bottles Developers.</p>
